## Quick Start

2. Enter the relevent meeting details
3. Once created, you can share the link with others, and also add your availability
4. Once everyone has added their availability, the interactive grid map allows you to see who all are available at a time, and you can schedule a meeting accordingly

## How AI was used

- **UI design** — The UI was manually designed in Figma, then quickly integrated into code with the help of AI.
- **Availability grid** — The drag-to-select time slot grid on the `/m/[slug]` page was implemented primarily with AI assistance.
- **Enhancements & bug fixes** — AI (CodeRabbit suggestions and general prompting) was used for incremental improvements, edge case handling, and fixing issues found during development.

## Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, pnpm, a Neon PostgreSQL database.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add your DATABASE_URL (Neon connection string)

# 3. migrate the database schema
npx drizzle-kit migrate

# 4. Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.
